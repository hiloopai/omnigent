// Regression guard for how src/main.js WIRES workspace-chrome injection, run
// with `node --test` (no extra deps). The wiring itself lives in
// src/workspace-chrome.js (registerWorkspaceChromeHide registers a
// did-finish-load listener that injects the chrome-hide CSS) and its BEHAVIOR is
// unit-tested in workspace-chrome.test.js. This guards the complementary half
// that no behavior test can see: that main.js still actually INVOKES
// registerWorkspaceChromeHide(win.webContents) as live code — not removed, not
// commented out.
//
// A naive source-string match would pass even if the call were commented out
// (the text still appears in the comment), so we strip comments from the source
// before asserting. URL slashes (`https://`) are preserved by only treating a
// `//` NOT preceded by `:` as a line comment. (This cannot prove the call runs
// at runtime — only an Electron launch could — but it does catch the call being
// removed or commented out, which the behavior test in workspace-chrome.test.js
// cannot, because that test never touches main.js.)
